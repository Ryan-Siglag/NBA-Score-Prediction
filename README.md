# NBA-Score-Prediction

This project aims to predict the final total score of NBA games. Several rolling features are created to capture a team's recent offensive/defensive performance, shooting efficiency, and pace. Two Random Forest Models are created. One is a RandomForestRegressor, which attempts to predict the final score. The other is a RandomForestClassifier, which attempts to indicate whether or not the final score is above or below the posted betting line.
