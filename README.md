# NBA-Score-Prediction

This project aims to predict the final total score of NBA games. Several rolling features are created to capture a teams recent offensive/defensive performance, shooting efficiency, and pace. Two Random Forest Models are created. One is a RandomForestRegressor which attempts to predict the number of the final score. The other is a RandomForestClassifier which attempts to predict whether or not the final score is above or below the posted betting line.
